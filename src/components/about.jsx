  <p className="mb-4">
    Hi, I'm Kezia—a linguistics senior at UTA and a tech-driven builder with a passion for bridging communication gaps. My work blends immersive learning, language tech, and inclusive design. From developing AI language tools to rolling out ERP systems for schools and nonprofits, my focus is making language more accessible and human for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m bilingual (English/Spanish), have experience with Chinese and Korean, and thrive on projects that sit at the intersection of language, technology, and education. Whether I’m designing AI-powered web apps, translating for my community, or researching the quirks of human language, I’m all about building tools that create connection and expand opportunities.
